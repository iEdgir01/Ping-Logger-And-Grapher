do the pip requirements 

research how to make a windows executable file and installer
first run

need to get pc location
update observation = mgr.weather_at_place("city,Code")

get personal API
by going to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
once signed in 
navigates to api keys page
checks if there is an existing one
otherwise generates one for you
copies the api key and pastes it in 'ping.py' line 25

once this program is installed it will run every hour
 for a full day / week / month to consolidate data into readable graphs <- user decides

open a text box explaining these steps
the application needs to use your location
and requests you sign in or create an account with openweathermap.org to gather weather data through an API key

allow users to use weather service or deny it
if denied these requirements will be skipped

accept or deny box
accept -> loading screen(does all of these actions and navigates you to openweathermap.org to get the API)
deny -> are you sure?
yes/ no 
no -> accept / deny screen
yes -> moves on to next stage

run portion of code in firstrun.py where it creates a blank output.txt file in the location of the desired install path
copy this install path and paste it the to code where it is required (outlined in program usage.txt)

at this point the program is fully functional. and working

the next part is just general gui things for ease of sccess and prettiness
next stage opens up a front end user sytem which allows a gui to check the data
a) check ping-
b) view graphs 
c) to be contined..

last thing to do is consolodate all the files into one file
